RAVL: (Richard's) AVL Tree Class
================================

An AVL tree is a form of self-balancing binary tree.

Many AVL tree implementations are difficult to understand, or do not include
a method to remove items from the tree. This class is, I think, cleanly written
and includes **insert** and **remove** methods, as well as various methods for
walking the tree.
